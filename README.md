# Wordle sample App

The game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) was one of the most viral internet games of the past few years. 
In 2022, it had around 3 million players worldwide.

You play by guessing different five-letter words to see how close they are to the secret word. When you submit a guess, the game will tell you how close your guess is by color-coding each letter in your guess.

This is a sample Wordle app that I worked on over a weekend. Every time you run the app, it selects a random word from its word list, and you have six rounds to guess the word, just like the original game.
